# Certification Protal
This app was created as part of Object-Oriented Programing Workshop (class #20586) of the Open University of Israel and is my final project in my Computer Science degree.

The purpose of the app is to manage all trainings and certifications for the manufacturing team at Zipline int.
The project is implemented as a web-based app, using Django and Django REST API for the backend, and React JS for the front end.
It is architectured using MVVM and multiple design patterns to ensure flexibility and expandability. 

The requirements for this project are listed in the object oriented analysis document (OOA), and a deep dive explanation about the systems design and architecture can be found in the object oriented design document (OOD).
